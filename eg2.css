Savitri Gets totally Involved in Whatever Roles She Play
Savitri Is no More.Her Versaitility Lives on and on and on
When people saw me on screen in Devadasu, they assumed that I starved myself to look like the heartbroken, alcoholic that I played on screen. Truth is far from it. I was actually healthy with robust looks. After watching myself I realised that no matter how hard i tried, I didn't look like a drunkard because my eyes were clear.
